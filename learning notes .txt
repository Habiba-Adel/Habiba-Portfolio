the first thing i learn is that once you use script to run in the package.json
you will need to put the file of package.json inside the backend folder cause if you not make that when running it will give you 
module not found and that cause the script really can not see the server.js file you mention it in the package.json
so the really important thing is to put the package.json file in the same place with the server.js

there is sometime the server may delay with you and may tell you that he cannot read any package you already installed it 
and you already used it so it is just glitch install npm again and close the server and open it again and all things will be okay 

if you destructing specific functions from the module ensure that the module is export all the functions even if it is just one single function
into object not just assigning
